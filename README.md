The executable jar file is located inside the "src/MultiplicationInAction" folder.

If you would like to choose which matrices to multiply, you can change the "MatrixOne" and "MatrixTwo" files inside the "src/MultiplicationInAction" folder and input them as arguments in the command line.

The user will then be prompted to input the sizes of the two matrices. These must be correct or the program will fail.

The program will then read the two matrices that have been inputed and print the results to the console as well as the "MatrixProduct" file located in the "src/MultiplicationInAction" folder.

If you would like to multiply two random matrices, you can run the program without arguments.

The user will then be prompted to input the size of both of the matrices.

After inputting the sizes, the program will generate two random matrices of the specified sizes and print them to the command line as well as the "MatrixOne" and "MatrixTwo" files inside the "OOB_Assigment_Five" folder.

Finally, the program will compute the product of the two matrices and print it to the command line as well as the "MatrixProduct" file located in the "OOB_Assigment_Five" folder.
